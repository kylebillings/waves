Waveform.JS
==========

Waveform.JS makes drawing [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) waveforms simple and
lets you **style** and **color** them the way you want. It comes as a small
JavaScript library and is using a lightweight service hosted on
[waveformjs.org](http://waveformjs.org) that translates the waveform image provided by
SoundCloud into an **array** of **floating points**.
